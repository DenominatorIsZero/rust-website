abstract = """
We demonstrate full 6D motion tracking using an early-stage triaxial magnetoelectric sensor array, addressing limitations in applications with restricted mobility or non-line-of-sight conditions. By combining a real-time magnetic signal preprocessing pipeline with a revised position and orientation estimation algorithm, we achieved tracking at ranges up to 50 cm with average errors of 1.4 cm for distance, 6.4 cm for position, and 27Â° for orientation. This proof of principle showcases the potential of magnetoelectric sensors for robust motion tracking in challenging environments.
