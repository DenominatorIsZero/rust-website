abstract = """
We present a magnetic estimation approach using shank-worn magnetoelectric sensors to measure step width, a key clinical motor marker for gait stability assessment. By comparing estimates to optical motion capture references during treadmill walking with eight healthy participants, we achieved high accuracy with mean absolute error â‰¤1 cm for step width and <0.1 cm for step width variability. The method demonstrates strong potential for wearable gait stability assessment in real-world conditions where traditional laboratory systems are impractical.
