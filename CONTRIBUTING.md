# Contributing to Rust Personal Website

Thank you for your interest in this project! This is primarily a personal learning project where I explore Rust web development and AI demonstrations in WebAssembly.

## What contributions are welcome?

While this is a personal website, I appreciate help with:

- **Bug reports** - If something isn't working as expected
- **Typos and errors** - Content corrections in posts or documentation
- **Security issues** - Vulnerabilities or security concerns
- **General feedback** - Questions about the technical approach

## How to contribute

2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce (for bugs)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (browser, OS) if relevant

### Security Vulnerabilities
