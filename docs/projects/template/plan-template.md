# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE_NAME]

Implementation roadmap with discrete, actionable tasks for building the [feature description].

## Plan Overview

This plan transforms the [specifications](spec-template.md) into a systematic implementation approach with clear phases, dependencies, and natural commit points.

### Implementation Strategy

- **Incremental Development**: Build and validate each component before moving to the next
- **Early Integration**: Test component interactions frequently to catch issues early
- **Natural Checkpoints**: Each task represents a stable, committable state
- **Dependency Management**: Later phases depend on earlier phases being complete

## Phase 4: Testing & Deployment

_Estimated effort: [X-Y] hours_

**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and deployment preparation

### Tasks

#### 4.1 Final Testing & Deployment Prep

**Status**: [ ] Pending  
**Dependencies**: 3.1  
**Definition of Done**:

- [ ] All functionality tested in development environment
- [ ] Docker build successful
- [ ] Production deployment ready
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Implementation Steps**:

- [ ] Comprehensive manual testing of all features
- [ ] Test Docker build: `docker build -t actix-web-app .`
- [ ] Test Docker deployment locally
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if new patterns or learnings emerged
- [ ] Clean up any development artifacts

## Website-Specific Implementation Notes

### Development Workflow
- Use `cargo watch -x run` for live reloading during development
- For CSS changes: `cd tailwind && npm run build-css-prod`
- Test Docker builds regularly: `docker build -t actix-web-app .`

### Integration Points
- **Templates**: Follow existing Tera template patterns in `templates/`
- **Handlers**: Add to appropriate handler file in `src/handlers/`
- **Routing**: Update `src/lib.rs` for new routes
- **Static Assets**: Place in `static/` with appropriate subdirectories

### Quality Gates
- Each phase should be tested in browser before proceeding
- All commits should leave the website in a working state
- Maintain existing privacy compliance and GDPR features
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all new UI components

### Success Metrics
- Feature works end-to-end as specified
- No regressions in existing website functionality
- Clean, maintainable code following existing patterns
- Ready for production deployment via Docker

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Feature works in development (`cargo run`)
- [ ] CSS builds correctly (`npm run build-css-prod`)
- [ ] Docker build succeeds
- [ ] All existing pages and features still work
- [ ] Mobile responsive design verified
- [ ] Privacy compliance maintained (if applicable)
- [ ] Analytics tracking working (if applicable)
