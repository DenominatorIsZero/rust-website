<h1> Hi, I'm {{ full_name }} {{ web_sep }} <a href="mailto:{{ my_email }}" class="break-all">{{ my_email }}</a></h1>
a recent PhD graduate in Digital Signal Processing from <a href="https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiel University</a>, specializing in
non-invasive electroanatomical mapping. With
a <a href="https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/bachelor-electrical-engineering-and-information-technology/" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor's in
    Electrical Engineering</a> and a <a href="https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/master-microelectronic-systems/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master's in
    Microelectronic Systems</a>, I combine expertise in advanced
signal processing techniques, real-time optimization, and machine learning to develop cutting-edge algorithms for
improving cardiac diagnosis.

<h2>My Research</h2>
I recently completed my <a href="https://www.biomagnetic-sensing.de/index.php/research/projects/project-b10"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhD research</a> on developing novel algorithms for non-invasive cardiac
electroanatomical mapping. My work bridges traditional signal processing and modern machine learning techniques,
providing more accurate and less invasive methods for diagnosing heart conditions. I have successfully submitted my
dissertation and am preparing for my defense.

During my PhD, I developed expertise in working with large codebases and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams,
using <a href="https://kirat.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KiRAT</a>,
a real-time framework built in C and C++, with Qt for user interfaces. My technical toolkit includes Rust, Python,
C++, and OpenCL, with extensive experience in Git/GitLab for collaborative development.

<h2>Transitioning to Industry</h2>
As I complete my academic journey, I'm transitioning into an AI engineering position in industry. My
unique combination of signal processing expertise, machine learning knowledge, and teaching experience positions me well
for roles in healthcare AI, algorithm development, and technical leadership. I'm particularly excited about working with
companies developing innovative AI applications that can make a real-world impact.

<h2>Lifelong Learner & Beyond</h2>
Outside of my core work, I'm passionate about continuous learning and exploring new fields. Whether it's diving deep
into the intricacies of Transformers in machine learning or studying the latest developments in AI, I'm always
expanding my knowledge and applying it to solve complex problems.

<h2>Let's Connect</h2>
I'm excited about applying my research expertise to industry challenges in my new AI engineering role. If you're
interested in my work or would like to connect professionally, feel free to reach out!
